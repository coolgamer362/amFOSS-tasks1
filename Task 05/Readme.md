Task 05 was quite enjoyable for me. Having previous experience creating websites with friends, I found the project, especially the CSS part, to be particularly fun. Although the project isnâ€™t fully functional as I had hoped, I did my best to make it work. I had a great time learning HTML and JavaScript, and I look forward to applying this knowledge to create even better websites in the future.
