# Terminal- Chaos Explanation
# Part - 1
Part 1 faced to be quite challenging for me as i was not at all familiar with linux commands and linux in general as well. But with the resource provided with repo for learning linux commands it become easier and i was able to learn most of the commands which helped me navigate through files required for the task. I navigated to Eolian caves in Task 1 as directed in the task description and opened the contents of parchment.txt and obtained the code.


# Part - 2
In part 2 i was quite confused what to do for some time, but then finally found out that we were supposed to switch to light-realm. Then checked out all the folders and files in it as directed.


# Part - 3
Part 3 was moderately challenging as i was unable to find the code to defeat Kharnok, finally after using grep in the proper thanks to a Stack Overflow answer. Finally i was able to obtain all the files that contatined 'holy' and 'good', and rearranged the specicfied files in the way as directed and got the magic spell. At last I was able to defeat Kharnok using the obtained magic spell and then i got the celestial amulet dropped by Kharnok which proved to quite useful in the later parts.


# Part - 4
Went to Dark-Realm-I and Dark-Realm-II and found the chests, opened it using the amulet's code and gaining two more codes from Darkbook-I and Darkbook-II. After that, I combined all the codes as directed and decoded the code which lead to a repository called God-Suite. Cloned the repo and read the scripture inside it.

# Part-5
I read all the commits in the God Suite repo and got the code for another repository which had to be decoded as well, which led to another repository called To the stars and realms unseen. Cloned the repository and ran the final victory file which displayed the victory message.
