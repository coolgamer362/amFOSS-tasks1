The Plague,Albert Camus,"“Its relevance lashes you across the face.” —Stephen Metcalf, The Los Angeles Times • “A redemptive book, one that wills the reader to believe, even in a time of despair.” —Roger Lowenstein, The Washington Post A haunting tale of human resilience and hope in the face of unrelieved horror, Albert Camus' iconic novel about an epidemic ravaging the people of a North African coastal town is a classic of twentieth-century literature. The townspeople of Oran are in the grip of a deadly plague, which condemns its victims to a swift and horrifying death. Fear, isolation and claustrophobia follow as they are forced into quarantine. Each person responds in their own way to the lethal disease: some resign themselves to fate, some seek blame, and a few, like Dr. Rieux, resist the terror. An immediate triumph when it was published in 1947, The Plague is in part an allegory of France's suffering under the Nazi occupation, and a timeless story of bravery and determination against the precariousness of human existence.",1991-05-07,en,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=KVGd-NabpW0C&dq=subject:Fiction&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api

Journey to the Center of the Earth,Jules Verne,"The intrepid Professor Lindenbrock embarks upon the strangest expedition of the nineteenth century: a journey down an extinct Icelandic volcano to the Earth’s very core. In his quest to penetrate the planet’s primordial secrets, the geologist—together with his quaking nephew Axel and their devoted guide, Hans—discovers an astonishing subterranean menagerie of prehistoric proportions. Verne’s imaginative tale is at once the ultimate science fiction adventure and a reflection on the perfectibility of human understanding and the psychology of the questor. As David Brin notes in his Introduction, though Verne never knew the term “science fiction,” Journey to the Centre of the Earth is “inarguably one of the wellsprings from which it all began.”",2006-04-25,en,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=icKmd-tlvPMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Fiction&hl=&cd=3&source=gbs_api
The Picture of Dorian Gray,Oscar Wilde,"The Picture of Dorian Gray is the only published novel by Oscar Wilde, appearing as the lead story in Lippincott's Monthly Magazine on 20 June 1890, printed as the July 1890 issue. The magazine's editors feared the story was indecent as submitted, so they censored roughly 500 words, without Wilde's knowledge, before publication. But even with that, the story was still greeted with outrage by British reviewers, some of whom suggested that Wilde should be prosecuted on moral grounds, leading Wilde to defend the novel aggressively in letters to the British press. Today, Wilde's fin de siècle novella is considered a classic. This new edition from Immortal Books includes footnotes and images.",2019-07-12,en,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=6vGiDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Fiction&hl=&cd=4&source=gbs_api

The Trial,Franz Kafka,"The story of the mysterious indictment, trial, and reckoning forced upon Joseph K—one of the twentieth century’s master parables from one of the greatest writers of the twentieth century, the author of The Metamorphosis. Translated by Willa and Edwin Muir The Trial reflects the central spiritual crises of modern life. Kafka’s method—one that has influenced, in some way, almost every writer of substance who followed him—was to render the absurd and the terrifying convincing by a scrupulous, hyperreal matter-of-factness of tone and treatment. He thereby imparted to his work a level of seriousness normally associated with civilization’s most cherished poems and religious texts. Everyman's Library pursues the highest production standards, printing on acid-free cream-colored paper, with full-cloth cases with two-color foil stamping, decorative endpapers, silk ribbon markers, European-style half-round spines, and a full-color illustrated jacket.
