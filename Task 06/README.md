# YouTube Music Desktop 
## Overview
** YTMDesktop is an open-source desktop application that provides a native experience for YouTube Music on your computer. The goal of the project is to create a desktop app that allows users to interact with YouTube Music more seamlessly than through a web browser. **

## Key Features:

### Native Application: ** Unlike using a web browser to access YouTube Music, YTMDesktop offers a dedicated desktop application that might include native features and better integration with the operating system. **

### Improved User Experience: ** The app is designed to provide a more integrated and efficient experience for managing and listening to music on YouTube Music. **

### Open Source: ** Being open source, it allows developers to contribute to its development, customize it, or use it as a base for their own projects. **
