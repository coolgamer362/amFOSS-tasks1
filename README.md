# Self Introduction
My Greetings to everyone at amFOSS.
I am Sabarinath.B (S1 AI & DS ), i am quite a novice to the world of programming but i have a background in the world of graphic and website designing. I am fascinated by the problem solving potential of programming and AI. I wish to pursue more into the field of AI as it appeals to me the most because of the endless possiblites that it poses.


# Why you should choose me?
Although i am new to the world of programming, i have contributed my fair share to the world of 3d desingning and photoshop. Without  open source softwares like blender and gimp, i would not be where i am right now with regards to growth. I was able to help my family financially even if it was in a small way because of it, i am very proud of that. I have also designed a few websites along with my friends in the past. I was fascinated by the world of programming, i decided to delve deeper into it only to find myself lost in it with joy. Although I acknowledge my tendency to procrastinate, i believe it brings out the creative side of me. I am a staunch believer in Free and Open Source Software and wish to spread the word about it to the unwaware. I am also determined to dedicate all my knowledge and strength to amfoss so that i am able to hone my skills and help others in need.  I believe my design background, combined with my enthusiasm for learning, makes me a valuable asset to the community. I am confident that I can contribute meaningfully to amFOSS and grow as a programmer.
