# Self Introduction
--> My Greetings to everyone at amFOSS.
I am Sabarinath.B (S1 AI & DS ), i am quite a novice to the world of programming but i have a background in the world of graphic and website designing. I am fascinated by the problem solving potential of programming and AI. I wish to pursue more into the field of AI as it appeals to me the most because of the endless possiblites that it poses.


# Why you should choose me?
--> Although i am new to the world of programming, i have contributed my fair share to the world of 3d desingning and photoshop. Without  open source softwares like blender and gimp, i would not be where i am right now with regards to growth. I was able to help my family financially even if it was in a small way because of it, i am very proud of that. I have also designed a few websites along with my friends in the past. I was fascinated by the world of programming, i decided to delve deeper into it only to find myself lost in it with joy. Although I acknowledge my tendency to procrastinate, i believe it brings out the creative side of me. I am a staunch believer in Free and Open Source Software and wish to spread the word about it to the unwaware. I am also determined to dedicate all my knowledge and strength to amfoss so that i am able to hone my skills and help others in need.  I believe my design background, combined with my enthusiasm for learning, makes me a valuable asset to the community. I am confident that I can contribute meaningfully to amFOSS and grow as a programmer.


# How do I intend to contribute back to the club?
--> I intend to contribute back to the club by spreading the word about Free and Open Source Software to the people unaware and create additional tools for the open source community to make the lives of people easier. I will try to help any club member to the best of my knowledge if they are in need of any help.


# What are my fields of interest, and how do I plan on working on them?
--> My fields of interest are mainly 3d designing, graphic desigining and gaming as well. I wish to work on them by creating additional AI driven tools / plugins for making tasks easier. I wish to keep honing my programming and problem solving skills so that i may be able to contribute more to the community.
